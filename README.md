# Pseudo-label-Driven-Continual-Learning
This project focused on building an end-to-end continual learning pipeline to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in evolving datasets. Implemented using PyTorch and HuggingFace, the framework explored feature extraction through multiple backbones such as ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT).
